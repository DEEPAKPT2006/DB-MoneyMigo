## 🎯 Error 2: Unauthorized Domain (Google Sign-In)

Your current domain is: **`{copy from error message or browser URL}`**

#### Step 2: Open Firebase Settings
Click here: [Firebase Authentication Settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/studio-4094080917-c3f91/authentication/settings)

2. Click **"Add domain"** button
3. Paste your domain (no `http://` or `https://`)
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to take effect

#### Step 4: Test
1. Refresh MoneyMigo
2. Click **Google** sign-in button

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Pre-Authorized Domains
These domains are **already authorized** (no setup needed):
- ✅ `localhost` (for local development)
- ✅ `127.0.0.1` (localhost IP)
- ✅ `*.firebaseapp.com` (your Firebase hosting)
- ✅ `*.web.app` (your Firebase hosting)

### Tip 2: Wildcard Not Supported
